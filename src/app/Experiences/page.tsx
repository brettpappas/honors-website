                For this experience I spent time learning how to program in the language Swift. Swift is a programming language which was created by Apple and is used for programming all of their devices. My experience consisted of me reading through tutorials and watching videos which I collected and compiled into a swift file which has common applications of different ideas to help me if I ever forget the syntax of code or need to see how I would go about creating a new function in my code. This experience has been very impactful on me, I have applied this idea that I have done here and used it for multiple other programming languages such as C++ which I already have experience in, but the cheat sheet like file has been extremely helpful, and more recently I have also learned Java for my upcoming co-op where that will be my primary language I am using. This experience has also allowed me to test the waters of self learning, especially in computer science. Up until now most of my programming experience had come from the classroom, but by participating in this self-designed honors experience I have gotten to go out of my comfort zone and learn in a new way which I will need to continue to use even once I graduate.
